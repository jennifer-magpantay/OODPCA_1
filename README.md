# Object Orientation with Design Patterns CA 1

Student: Jennifer Magpantay ID 2017325

Lecture: Amilcar Aponte - CCT College Dublin

Practical Project:

As part of our practical exercises, the students were asked to create a simple program following Object Orientation with Design Patterns principles, where would be possible for a user access a database to search through it and even add a new element to it.

Three different patterns should be implemented in the program, considering DAO as a mandatory pattern. The other two patterns, both creative patterns, were free of choice for the students.
